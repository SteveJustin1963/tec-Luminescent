### What is electroluminescence
What is electroluminescence process? Electroluminescence is a characteristic of a material, typically a semiconductor, that enables it to emit light in response to an electrical current or a strong electrical field. The process behind electroluminescence is radiative recombination, also known as spontaneous emission.

Electroluminescence is a luminescence which arises from electrical influences. The technologically most important type of electroluminescence, as exploited in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), occurs in semiconductor p–n junctions, where an electric current can generate electron–hole pairs...Electroluminescence is the basis of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in which a p-n junction diode can emit light when an appropriate voltage is applied, so that electrons recombine with electron holes in the device to release energy in the form of photons...Electroluminescence Backlights for LCD modules...also called an ELP (Electroluminescence Panel)...uses colored phosphors, not heat, to generate light and can be added to many LCD technologies.

What is electroluminescence in laser? Electroluminescence is a phenomenon of certain materials such as semiconductors that causes the material to emit light due to a strong electric field or passage of an electric current. 

What is the difference between photoluminescence and electroluminescence? The key difference between photoluminescence and electroluminescence is that photoluminescence occurs following the absorption of a photon, whereas electroluminescence occurs through the generation of light by the application of an alternating current to a semiconductor.

What are electroluminescent polymers? Electroluminescent polymers are organic polymers that emit light upon application of an electric field. What is used as cathode in electroluminescent polymers? ...indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass or polymer substrate is chosen as the (transparent) anode, and the cathode consists of a vacuum deposited metal layer.

What are electroluminescent materials? Electroluminescent materials (ELs), such as zinc sulphide doped with copper 1, emit light when an electrical current or voltage is applied to it, or when subject to a strong electric field. Such materials are generally inorganic phosphors, or organic semiconductors, such as quartz.

### LumiLor 
is an electroluminescent coating system which allows anything coated with it to function as a light. Electroluminescence simply means that an object is capable of emitting light when an electrical current passes through it. The lifespan of LumiLor is dependent on how much power is applied and the native LumiLor color used. More power equals brighter light but a shorter half life. The life of the product has been measured over 10,000 hours, and in some up to 50,000 hours. Charging and discharging LumiLor does not affect the half-life. LumiLor only degrades towards its half life when it is charged. The Lumicolor layer is currently available in white, blue, aqua, green, orange, Yellow, Violet and Pink colors. The lighting sequence can be controlled in various ways, such as – simple on or off, strobe effect, sequencing, and motion & sound activation. 

### experiments
- https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.95.941; properties of ZnS: Cu: Pb and ZnS: Cu: Pb: Mn electroluminescent phosphors is reported. The experiments include studies of the optical and electrical response of these phosphors dispersed in "Lucite" (Lucite, also called Plexiglas, British Perspex, trademark name of polymethyl methacrylate, a synthetic organic compound of high molecular weight made by combination of many simple molecules of the ester methyl methacrylate (monomer) into long chains (polymer)

- Electroluminescent wire (often abbreviated as EL wire) EL Wire requires an inverter to light up. is a thin copper wire coated in a phosphor that produces light through electroluminescence when an alternating current is applied to it. At 3 meters, its not as bright, it appears about the same as 'classic' EL. Each meter of high brightness EL draws about 10-15mA at the high voltage, which means about 1.5 Watt/meter (at 100VAC). You can cut EL to any length or shape, but you must reseal the ends you cut. If you do not have an end cap for the EL wire, you can still seal the ends with hot glue or epoxy to seal cut wire. If you don't reseal, you could end up getting a good jolt. Nearly every el wire inverter or battery pack that has been made to date uses a very high frequency (generally over 1500Hz), which tend to make a loud humming noise which is in our audible range, and can be annoying in quiet environments. https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-electroluminescent-el-wire/all

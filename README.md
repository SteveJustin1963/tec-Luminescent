### LumiLor 
is an electroluminescent coating system which allows anything coated with it to function as a light. Electroluminescence simply means that an object is capable of emitting light when an electrical current passes through it. The lifespan of LumiLor is dependent on how much power is applied and the native LumiLor color used. More power equals brighter light but a shorter half life. The life of the product has been measured over 10,000 hours, and in some up to 50,000 hours. Charging and discharging LumiLor does not affect the half-life. LumiLor only degrades towards its half life when it is charged. The Lumicolor layer is currently available in white, blue, aqua, green, orange, Yellow, Violet and Pink colors. The lighting sequence can be controlled in various ways, such as â€“ simple on or off, strobe effect, sequencing, and motion & sound activation.

Electroluminescence is the phenomenon of certain materials, such as semiconductors, emitting light in response to an electrical current or a strong electrical field. This is due to a process called radiative recombination or spontaneous emission. Electroluminescence is widely used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and backlights for LCD modules. It is also used in electroluminescent polymers, which are organic polymers that emit light when an electric field is applied to them. The cathode in electroluminescent polymers is usually made of a vacuum-deposited metal layer, while the anode is typically made of indium tin oxide on a glass or polymer substrate. Photoluminescence, on the other hand, occurs following the absorption of a photon. Electroluminescent materials (ELs) are generally inorganic phosphors, or organic semiconductors, such as quartz.


## What is electroluminescence process? 
is a characteristic of a material, typically a semiconductor, that enables it to emit light in response to an electrical current or a strong electrical field. The process behind electroluminescence is radiative recombination, also known as spontaneous emission.

Electroluminescence is a luminescence which arises from electrical influences. The technologically most important type of electroluminescence, as exploited in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), occurs in semiconductor p–n junctions, where an electric current can generate electron–hole pairs...Electroluminescence is the basis of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in which a p-n junction diode can emit light when an appropriate voltage is applied, so that electrons recombine with electron holes in the device to release energy in the form of photons...Electroluminescence Backlights for LCD modules...also called an ELP (Electroluminescence Panel)...uses colored phosphors, not heat, to generate light and can be added to many LCD technologies.

## What is electroluminescence in laser? 
is a phenomenon of certain materials such as semiconductors that causes the material to emit light due to a strong electric field or passage of an electric current. 

## What is the difference between photoluminescence and electroluminescence? 
The key difference between photoluminescence and electroluminescence is that photoluminescence occurs following the absorption of a photon, whereas electroluminescence occurs through the generation of light by the application of an alternating current to a semiconductor.

## What are electroluminescent polymers? 
are organic polymers that emit light upon application of an electric field. What is used as cathode in electroluminescent polymers? ...indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass or polymer substrate is chosen as the (transparent) anode, and the cathode consists of a vacuum deposited metal layer.

## What are electroluminescent materials? 
(ELs), such as zinc sulphide doped with copper 1, emit light when an electrical current or voltage is applied to it, or when subject to a strong electric field. Such materials are generally inorganic phosphors, or organic semiconductors, such as quartz.

## LumiLor 
is an electroluminescent coating system which allows anything coated with it to function as a light. Electroluminescence simply means that an object is capable of emitting light when an electrical current passes through it. The lifespan of LumiLor is dependent on how much power is applied and the native LumiLor color used. More power equals brighter light but a shorter half life. The life of the product has been measured over 10,000 hours, and in some up to 50,000 hours. Charging and discharging LumiLor does not affect the half-life. LumiLor only degrades towards its half life when it is charged. The Lumicolor layer is currently available in white, blue, aqua, green, orange, Yellow, Violet and Pink colors. The lighting sequence can be controlled in various ways, such as – simple on or off, strobe effect, sequencing, and motion & sound activation. 

## electroluminescent phosphors
- https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.95.941; The article reports that slow changes are found to take place in a phosphor in any given constant electric field, but a steady state is finally approached. A sudden departure from this state produced by changing the applied field will in general produce very little light compared to that produced on returning promptly to the conditions under which the steady state was established. The luminescence in alternating electric fields of individual grains is also found to be extremely inhomogeneous, being restricted to small "pinpoints" or "spots" much smaller than the individual particles.
The article concludes that excitation of luminescent centers occurs primarily by ionization, with recombination and radiation occurring when subsequent electrical changes make this possible. Although excitation of luminescent centers to bound states followed by prompt radiation does occur, under the conditions of these experiments this process is of secondary importance in producing light in all the phosphors studied, and is quite negligible in the green phosphors.


## Electroluminescent wire 
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-electroluminescent-el-wire/all (often abbreviated as EL wire) is a thin copper wire coated in a phosphor that produces light through electroluminescence when an alternating current is applied to it. It requires an inverter to light up. At 3 meters, it's not as bright as classic EL and appears about the same. Each meter of high-brightness EL draws about 10-15mA at high voltage, which means about 1.5 watts per meter at 100VAC. EL wire can be cut to any length or shape, but the ends must be resealed with an end cap or hot glue or epoxy to prevent electric shock. Many EL wire inverters or battery packs use a high frequency, generally over 1500Hz, which can produce a loud humming noise that can be annoying in quiet environments.
